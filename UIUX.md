In terms of UI design and user experience optimization for this project, I have done the following work:

1. The dashboard page adopts a card style design to display each slide. In addition to displaying basic information such as the slide's title and update time, each card also provides quick editing and deletion operations. At the same time, the cards are arranged in a grid format, making it clear at a glance.
2. On the editing page, list all slides in the form of thumbnails on the left for easy switching; On the right is the editing area of the currently selected slide, where users can preview the modified effect in real-time. The header area at the top integrates common operations such as return, preview, and save, making it smoother to use.
3. Each page has independent routing and supports forward and backward operations and bookmark bookmarking, enhancing the usability of the application.
